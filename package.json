  "description": "This video explores the computational power of dendrites in biological neurons, challenging the simplistic view of neurons as mere perceptrons. It discusses how voltage-gated ion channels and dendritic spikes enable individual neurons to perform complex computations, such as the exclusive-or (XOR) operation, which was previously thought to require multi-layered networks. The video also highlights recent research showing that single cortical neurons can be modeled as deep convolutional neural networks, emphasizing the incredible information processing capabilities of the brain at the cellular level.",
