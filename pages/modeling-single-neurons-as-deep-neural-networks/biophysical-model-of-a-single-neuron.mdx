# Biophysical Model of a Single Neuron

To understand how single neurons can perform complex computations, researchers created a detailed biophysically realistic model of a cortical neuron. This model was based on a reconstructed morphology of a real neuron and incorporated various mathematical equations describing the dynamics of membrane voltage, ion channel behavior, and ionic fluxes.

<Callout type="info">
The biophysical model used in this study is an example of a multi-compartmental model, which divides the neuron into multiple segments, each with its own set of equations governing the electrical and chemical properties.

The key components of the biophysical model include:

- **Reconstructed morphology**: The spatial structure of the neuron, including the soma, dendrites, and axon, was based on a real cortical neuron's morphology.

- **Membrane voltage dynamics**: The model described the changes in membrane potential over time using the cable equation, which takes into account the capacitive and resistive properties of the cell membrane.

- **Ion channel kinetics**: The opening and closing of various ion channels, such as voltage-gated sodium, potassium, and calcium channels, were modeled using differential equations that capture their voltage-dependent and time-dependent behavior.

- **Ionic fluxes**: The movement of ions across the cell membrane through ion channels was modeled based on the electrochemical gradients and the conductance of the channels.

### Step 1

The reconstructed morphology of the neuron was divided into multiple compartments, each representing a small segment of the cell membrane.

### Step 2

For each compartment, the model included equations describing the membrane voltage dynamics, ion channel kinetics, and ionic fluxes.

### Step 3

The model was simulated by numerically solving the coupled differential equations across all compartments, allowing researchers to observe the spatial and temporal evolution of the neuron's electrical activity.

Here's an example of the cable equation used to describe the membrane voltage dynamics in a single compartment:

$$C_m\frac{dV_m}{dt} = -\sum_i I_i + \frac{V_m - V_{rest}}{R_m}$$

where $C_m$ is the membrane capacitance, $V_m$ is the membrane potential, $I_i$ represents the ionic currents through different types of ion channels, $R_m$ is the membrane resistance, and $V_{rest}$ is the resting membrane potential.

To study the neuron's input-output relationship, the biophysical model was stimulated with a set of synaptic inputs, and the resulting voltage trace at the soma was recorded as the output. This detailed model served as a ground truth for comparing the computational capabilities of single neurons with artificial neural networks, as discussed in the [Equivalent Deep Neural Network](/modeling-single-neurons-as-deep-neural-networks/equivalent-deep-neural-network) section.
