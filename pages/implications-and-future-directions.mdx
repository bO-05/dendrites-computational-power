# Implications and Future Directions

The findings discussed in this video have significant implications for both neuroscience and artificial intelligence. By recognizing the incredible computational power of single neurons, we can gain a deeper understanding of how the brain processes information and develop more biologically-plausible AI models.

## Implications for Neuroscience

The discovery of complex dendritic computations, such as the ability to perform the [XOR operation](/the-role-of-dendrites-in-neural-computations/dendritic-spikes-and-xor-operation), challenges the traditional view of neurons as simple perceptrons. This insight opens up new avenues for research in neuroscience, including:
